#Wundercam-(simple)

Simple script for taking images from a TP link webcam and pushing them to wunderground then making a local timelapse


#Basics
This script is a simple bash script there are 2 parts, the capture part and the timelapse part. Maybe someday I'll write this in ruby, but for now its working this way.
